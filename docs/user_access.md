Technical Specification: User Access Levels and Profile Management

1. Description:
The contact list system requires different access levels for users, including admin, supervisor, and regular users. Additionally, users should have the ability to manage their profile information. This specification outlines the features and functionality related to user access levels and profile management.

2. Features:
a) User Access Levels:
   - The system should support three access levels: admin, supervisor, and user.
   - Each access level should have different permissions and capabilities within the system.
   - Admin users have the highest level of access and can perform all administrative tasks.
   - Supervisor users have elevated privileges but with certain limitations compared to admin users.
   - Regular users have limited access rights and can perform basic functions.

b) User Profile Page:
   - Each user should have a profile page where they can view and update their profile information.
   - Profile information may include the user's name, profile picture, contact details, and any other relevant information.

c) Profile Information Update:
   - Users should be able to edit and update their profile information.
   - The system should provide a user-friendly interface for users to modify their profile details.
   - Changes made to the profile should be saved and reflected in the system.

d) Profile Picture Update:
   - Users should have the ability to upload or change their profile picture.
   - The system should provide an option to browse and select an image file for the profile picture.
   - The uploaded picture should be displayed in the user's profile page and throughout the system.

3. User Interface:
   - The user profile page and related profile management functionality should have an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
   - Users should be able to easily navigate and find the necessary options to update their profile information and profile picture.
   - Clear instructions and error messages should be provided to assist users in completing the profile management tasks.

4. Integration and Dependencies:
   - The user access levels and profile management features should be integrated with the overall user management system and database.
   - User data, including access levels and profile information, should be stored and retrieved from the database as required.

5. Security Measures:
   - User profile information, including access levels, should be securely stored and protected.
   - Access to sensitive user data should be restricted based on the user's access level and appropriate authorization mechanisms.
   - Security measures, such as input validation, to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of user profiles, should be implemented.

6. Testing:
   - The user access levels and profile management functionality should undergo thorough testing to ensure its accuracy and security.
   - Test cases should cover scenarios such as updating profile information, changing profile pictures, handling different access levels, and validating security measures.
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests should be conducted to verify the implementation.
