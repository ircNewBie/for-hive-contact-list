Technical Specification: User Invitation and Friend Management

1. Description:
The contact list system allows users to invite other users as friends and manage their friend list. This specification outlines the features and functionality related to user invitation and friend management.

2. Features:
a) User Invitation:
   - Users should have the ability to send friend invitations to other users within the system.
   - The system should provide a mechanism (e.g., email notification) to notify the invited user about the friend request.
   - The invitation should include relevant information such as the sender's username or name.

b) Friend Request Handling:
   - When a user receives a friend invitation, they should have the capability to accept or deny the request.
   - The system should provide options for the invited user to accept the friend request and add the sender as a friend or reject the request.

c) Friend List Management:
   - Users should be able to manage their friend list, including adding new friends, removing existing friends, and viewing the list of current friends.
  

d) Contact Sharing:
   - Users should have the ability to share their contacts with other users who are on their friend list.
   - The system should provide options for users to select specific contacts or groups of contacts to share.
   - Shared contacts should be accessible to the recipients for viewing and potentially adding to their own contact list.

3. User Interface:
   - The user interface for user invitation, friend request handling, and friend list management should be intuitive and easy to use.
   - Clear instructions and visual cues should guide users in sending invitations, responding to friend requests, and managing their friend list.
   - Relevant information, such as pending friend requests or shared contacts, should be clearly displayed to users.

4. Integration and Dependencies:
   - The user invitation and friend management features should be integrated with the overall user management and contact list system.
   - User data, friend relationships, and shared contact information should be stored and retrieved from the database as required.

5. Security Measures:
   - Friend requests and shared contacts should be handled securely to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
   - Access to shared contacts should be limited to the intended recipients and controlled by appropriate authorization mechanisms.

6. Testing:
   - The user invitation and friend management functionality should be thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and security.
   - Test cases should cover scenarios such as sending friend invitations, accepting or denying friend requests, managing the friend list, and validating security measures.
   - Integration tests and user acceptance tests should be conducted to verify the implementation.
