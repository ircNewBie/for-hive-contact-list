Technical Specification: Sign Up and Sign In Page

1. Description:
The sign-up and sign-in page is the entry point for users to access the contact list system. It allows users to create new accounts or authenticate themselves to gain access to the system.

2. Features:
a) User Registration:
   - Users should be able to provide their desired username, password, and other required information to create a new account.
   - The system should validate the provided information, such as checking for unique usernames and enforcing password complexity rules.
   - Upon successful registration, the user should be redirected to the sign-in page.

b) User Authentication:
   - Users should be able to provide their username and password to authenticate themselves and gain access to the system.
   - The system should verify the provided credentials against the stored user data to authenticate the user.
   - If the provided credentials are valid, the user should be granted access to the system and redirected to their profile page or the system dashboard.
 

c) Security Measures:
   - The sign-up and sign-in process should be secure to protect user data.
   - User passwords should be stored securely using strong encryption techniques (e.g., salted hashing).
   - Measures such as CAPTCHA or rate limiting can be implemented to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. User Interface:
   - The sign-up and sign-in page should have a user-friendly interface, clearly indicating the required fields and providing helpful error messages in case of invalid input.
   - The page should be responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.

4. Integration and Dependencies:
   - The sign-up and sign-in page should be integrated with the overall contact list system.
   - It should communicate with the backend server or authentication service to handle user registration, authentication, and password recovery processes.

5. Testing:
   - The sign-up and sign-in page should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions correctly and securely.
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and security tests should be conducted to validate the implementation.
   - Test cases should cover both valid and invalid scenarios, including edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities.
